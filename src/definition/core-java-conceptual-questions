What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.
oop is short for object oriented programming which is technique in writing code
which enhance code maintability, reuseability and readability.
OOP featues are inheritance, abstraction, polymerphism and encapsulation
encapsulation: protecting instance data by making them private and provide setter and getter methods
polymerphism: providing different implementation of method depending on object type to perfom different tasks
inheritance: allowing class to be extended to add more features and specilazation
abstraction: hiding the implementation with showing functionality only

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.
package is group of related classes put together in some directory,
the default imported package is java.lang and the no-name package

A.
API is having two or more classes communicate together to build software,
some of APIs: JDBC, Collection, String, Math

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.
Java doesn't allow a class to inherit more than one class to prevent duplication of instance data,
however it allow to implement more than 1 interface

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.
overloading is having more than 1 method in class with same name but different number of
parameters and different type of parameters. it should be in same class

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.
exception is an event during execution which stops the flow of program running due
to an issue or problem in code. we should handle it by try/catch methodaligy

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.
static keyword is used to define class level variable/method, static members are
not allow to access non-static members of class.
we use it in variables and method by adding keyword static in definition

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.
final is used to define constant data which can't be changed or modified, if added
to variable or method it means it must have a value/body and it can't change later.
we use it in variable and method

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.
final is used to define constant variables and methods
finally is used within try/catch to perform end tasks like closing db connection or files
finalize is a method used for collect object data before dumping from memory

What is a constructor ?
A.
constructor is special method with no return type which is called when object is created
using the new keyword, it must have same name as class

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.
yes, we can overload constructors with having different type/number of parameters

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.
java create a default no-argument constructor if no constructors are created

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.
this is used to refer for current object instance data or methods and can be used
to call other constructor from constructor

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.
super is used to refer super class non private instance data and methods, also
can be used from constructor to call super class constructor

What is JVM stand for ?
A.
JVM stands for java virtual machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A.
Yes it's depending on operating system, where each os have different jvm but all perform the same

What version of java are you using?
A.
java 17

What is JAR stand for ?
A.
a java archieve

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.
the JDK is the java development kit which include the JVM, JRE and others

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.
the JRE is the implementation of JVM which is basicly provide the libraries of java

What is compile time and run time?
A.
compile time is when java code converted to binary code
run time is when program run and happens after compile time

What is heap?
A.
heap is part of memory used to store created objects

How java manage it's memory?
A.
there is two type of memory in java heap and stack
heap is part of memory used to store created objects
stack is used for static memory allocation and execution of threads
then we have the garbage collector which collects objects that no longer used in heap

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.
String is immutable, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable
StringBuilder is more effiecient because it's not synchronized which allow more than thread to call it's methods

What is Singleton class?
A.
It's a design pattern states that a class can have only one object

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.
serialization is converting object to byte stream,
deserialization is converting byte stream to object

when to use transient variable in java?
A.
If we are serializing object but we don't want a variable to be serialized with it we mark it with transient keyword

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.
a do-while loop is guarnteed to execute atleast once even if the condition is false
the while loop can execute 0 or more times

What is Enum?
A.
A special data type which store group of predefined constants

What is Iterator?
A.
An object which allow to loop through any data structure such as LinkedList and ArrayList

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.
Integer is an object so it takes more memory to use

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.
because strings are cached in string pool, which enhance performance by saving heap memory

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.
It's the process of series of constructors calling other constructors in same class or super class

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.
the parallel collector use multiple threads which speed up the process, also parallel collector
is used with large size data

What is JIT stands for?
A.
Just-In-Time which is used to enhance performance of program in runtime

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.
the java heap is part of memory used to store objects created by the application
in JVM, when the heap becomes full the garbage collection collect the objects that are no longer
used or needed.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.
Programmer has no control over the garbage collection process, however garbage collection guarantee
that available memory will be used with collecting any objects no longer used.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.
heap is used by application to store all created objects, stack is used by one part
to store a local variable or method call so we can call the stack a temprorly memory

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.
reflection is the ability of inspect and manipulate classes and interfaces in runtime
it's useful that we don't modify our classes, instead we add new classes where our code
will just manipulate and modify in runtime to achieve purpose

what is multithreading in java?
A.
it's the process of executing more than one thread simultaneously for maximum use of cpu

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.
It's the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource

What is Framework?
A.
A pre-written classes and functions which is used to develop applications

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.
JUnit, TestNG, Mockito, Selenium and others.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.
testNG is java absed framework inspired by junit where it overcome the limitation of junit
the junit is a framework to write tests. also testNG allow for parallel tests junit doesn't allow

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.
A class is said to have dependency of another class if it uses an instance of that class

what is dependency injection in java?
A.
dependency injection is making code loose-coupled where objects shouldn't be created manually
instead we should define how the object is created and it will be injected in runtime by the framework not the programmer

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.
static binding when type of object is known in compile time, dynamic binding when type of
object is determined at runtime
